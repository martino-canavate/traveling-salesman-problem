### This is an approax to solve the travelling salesman problem.

The file 'report' explains what approach I have used to solve the problem and the file 'graph.py' is the implementation of the solution.

The files 'cities50', 'sixnodes' and 'twelvenodes' are example files of how to write the coordinates of the points we want our salesman to go to.

To use 'graph.py' to solve a specific problem, write a text file with coordinates (as in 'cities50'), modify the last line og 'graph.py' to accept as input your new coordinates file instead of 'cities50' and finally run 'graph.py'.
